# BookLibraryApp
 App I created on learning purposes using Java, MySQL and JDBC.
 
 In MainTest there is console menu, from where you can choose a role. Admin, memer or a quest.
 
 As admin, app will ask password and after successful login the admin menu will display. Admin can look at all books, remove & add books etc.
 
 As mebmer, app will ask member id and will assign it to book, if book is loeaned and give it a due date 14 days from current time. 
 If book is returned, everythig is set back to null.
 
 As member you can browse books and create membership.
 
 All data is stored in database.
